# Python Unit Testing Project ~ Sam's Surf Shop

This is a Python project for practicing unit testing. The code is a simple implementation of a shopping cart, and the goal of the project is to create and run tests for this code using the unittest module.

## Getting Started

To get started, you will need Python 3.x installed on your system. Clone this repository to your local machine and navigate to the project directory. 

## Running the Tests

The tests are contained in the `tests.py` file. To run the tests, open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory, and run the command `python tests.py`. This will execute all the tests and display the results in the console.

## Skills Learned

During this project, I learned how to:

- Write unit tests for Python code using the unittest module
- Use advanced features of unittest such as skipping, parameterization, and expected failures
- Identify and fix bugs in code using unit tests


## Acknowledgments

I completed this project as part of the **Learn Intermediate Python 3** course on Codecademy and I want to thank the course creators for putting together such a comprehensive and engaging learning experience.
